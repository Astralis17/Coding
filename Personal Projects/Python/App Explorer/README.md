Hello welcome to this shit thing I made
To start find the apps that you wish to use in the App Explorer and copy the path to their shortcuts and replace the "LinkHere" in the Links.py file
Next in the Links.py file change the "NameHere" to the name of the corresponding app
(NOTE:TO ADD THE LINKS AND NAMES YOU WILL NEED TO EDIT THE FILE)
